<time datetime="Tuesday 15 Oct 2024" class=text-muted>Tuesday 15 Oct 2024</time></div><div class=content><p><strong>Mitime</strong> (pronounced &ldquo;my time&rdquo;) is a <strong>mi</strong>nimal <strong>ti</strong>me <strong>me</strong>tastructure mapped over standard time that counts down available time in a day.</p><p>Mitime is represented by the following format:</p><blockquote><p><em>M.H.N</em></p></blockquote><p>Where:</p><ul><li><em>M</em> is the <strong>mi</strong> (<span class=michar>ᚃ</span>
), a magic number that represents the largest subdivisions of the day. A half mi is, naturally, a <strong>semi</strong>.</li><li><em>H</em> is the <em>mihour</em>. Like standard hours, mihours are 60 standard minutes in length, facilitating coordination with standard time. Mihours are subdivided and numbered relative to their containing mi.</li><li><em>N</em> is the <em>miminute</em>. Miminutes are subdivided and numbered relative to their containing mihour.</li></ul><p>Because mitime counts down, all numbers are reversed chronologically.</p><p>Standard time outside of mitime is unavailable time and is not tracked. This is represented as zero mitime, also known as mi 0 (&ldquo;my zero&rdquo;):</p><blockquote><p>0.0.0</p></blockquote><p>Mi 0 represents daily recurring negative leap time within the structure of mitime.</p><p><em>Mitimezones</em> describe the structure of mitime, and how mitime maps to standard time. Therefore, a completely explicit mitime reference will include its mitimezone in the following format starting with the basic mitime format already discussed above:</p><blockquote><p><em>M.H.N <span class=michar>ᚃ</span>
MC.HC.NC.S</em></p></blockquote><p>Where additionally:</p><ul><li><em>MC</em> is the mi count, or the number of mis in a day. Each mi is structured identically based on mihour count.</li><li><em>HC</em> is the mihour count, the number of mihours in a mi. Each mihour is structured identically based on miminute count.</li><li><em>NC</em> is the miminute count, the number of miminutes in a mihour.</li><li><em>S</em> is the <em>mistart</em>, the standard hour when mitime begins. Mistart is based on a 24 hour clock, like hours in military time.</li></ul><p>The mitime range that begins at mistart and ends at mi 0 is called <em>midai</em> (pronounced &ldquo;my day&rdquo;). Notice that because mitime counts down, mitimezones mirror mitime at mistart, and the last unit of mitime before 0.0.0 is 1.1.1 for all mitimezones.</p><p>The mitimezone <strong>4.4.4.6</strong> is the default reference mitimezone, called <em>Standard Mitime</em> and abbreviated <em>SM</em>. Standard Mitime is the most generalized structure and reflects a number of existing cultural expectations about the structure of time, such as 16 waking hours and the tendency to divide time by quarters, along with the concept of the &ldquo;business day.&rdquo;</p><p>In Standard Mitime, midai mistarts at 6am (4sm) and is 16 standard hours (and mihours) long, after subtracting 8 hours of sleep at night. This total available time is divided into quarters called mi that are each 4 standard hours duration. Each mi is divided into quarters called mihours that are each a standard hour duration. If needed, one can further divide each mihour into quarters called miminutes that are each 15 standard minutes duration.</p><p>Because both mihours and standard hours are 60 standard minutes in length, translating between mitime and standard time quickly becomes intuitive. To start, realize that in Standard Mitime, the mid-point of midai reflects standard time:</p><blockquote><p>2sm = 2pm</p></blockquote><p>All other Standard Mi boundaries fall on either 6&rsquo;s or 10&rsquo;s in standard time:</p><blockquote><p>4sm = 6am</p><p>3sm = 10am</p><p>2sm = 2pm</p><p>1sm = 6pm</p><p>0sm = 10pm</p></blockquote><p>Notice too that in Standard Mitime, at 8am (4.2sm), an eighth of the day–half of the first mi, a semi, two mihours–has passed in midai. Likewise at 8pm (1.2sm), an eighth of the day–half of the last mi, a semi, two mihours–remains in midai.</p><p>A <em>mitimer</em> displays Standard Mitime in the form of a traditional analog timer that counts down mitime, with <strong>midials</strong> that run counter-clockwise. The mitimer is read starting from the largest areas to the smallest, starting from the outside, moving inward.</p><figure id=miconsole-5ef92ae98e-container class="image gallery-item" style="max-width:300px;margin:3em auto"><article id=miconsole-5ef92ae98e style=max-width:300px></article><figcaption><span id=mitime-5ef92ae98e-container><span id=mitime-5ef92ae98e></span></span><br><span id=sttime-5ef92ae98e-container><span id=sttime-5ef92ae98e></span></span><br></figcaption></figure><script>mitimer("miconsole-5ef92ae98e","midial-5ef92ae98e","mitime-5ef92ae98e","sttime-5ef92ae98e",4,4,4,6,0,1,"mhn",12,0)</script><p>Instead of asking &ldquo;what time is it?&rdquo; one might instead ask &ldquo;what is mitime?&rdquo; At the midpoint of standard midai, one might respond with &ldquo;2sm&rdquo; which is short for 2.4.4sm in the same way that 2pm is short for 2:00pm. One might also give a more general answer, such as &ldquo;I am in mi 2&rdquo; (&ldquo;my two&rdquo;), the same block of time that someone else might call &ldquo;afternoon&rdquo;.</p><p>While Standard Mitime will meet the needs of many, anyone can configure their mitimezone to their unique needs. Mitimezones allow for cross-compatible variations, so experimentation is less expensive.</p><p>(Note too that because mistart can be any hour of the day, and the remaining structure is abstract, mitime can cross standard day boundaries.)</p><p>Whereas standard time progresses into the future, mitime&rsquo;s structure only counts down available time in midai. Knowing the standard time is good for keeping appointments, but mitime is better at providing an intuitive sense of where one is relative to the total available time in a day, and how much time is left in midai, which provides a natural structure for determining if one is on schedule or falling behind.</p><p>And whereas standard time defines points in time, mitime&rsquo;s structure defines blocks of time. When used as a planning tool, the general, uniform structure of mitime optimizes interchangeability of blocks of time, so if needed, remaining mitime can be rearranged simply and with minimal disruption.</p><p>Finally, because mitime is compatible with standard time, standard time is always available as a fallback time specifier alongside mitime when higher precision is genuinely needed.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/miwai/equal-time/>the mental shift of mitime</a></li><li><a href=/miwai/adapting-mitime/>adapting to mitime</a></li><li><a href=/miwai/mitime-design/>the design of mitime</a></li><li><a href=/miwai/initial-reflections/>Planning Midai</a></li><li><a href=/miwai/staggered-task-pattern/>Time Pattern: Task Dovetailing</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><div class=curve><svg viewBox="0 0 1440 142" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="m1440 0-80 11.981c-80 12.206-240 35.83-4e2 53.999-160 17.831-320 30.206-480 30.037-160 .16875-320-12.206-4e2-18L0 71.9984v71.998h80 4e2 480 4e2 80z"/></svg></div><div class=inner><article class=summary><h3><a href=/miwhi/>miwhi</a></h3><div class=meta><time>Wednesday 21 Aug 2024</time></div><div class=content>the motivation behind mitime<a href=/miwhi/ class=more-link>read more</a></div></article><article class=summary><h3><a href=/mikei/>mikei</a></h3><div class=meta><time>Tuesday 15 Oct 2024</time></div><div class=content>the essential reference<a href=/mikei/ class=more-link>read more</a></div></article><article class=summary><h3><a href=/midai/>midai</a></h3><div class=meta><time>Wednesday 01 Nov 2023</time></div><div class=content>making the most of mitime<a href=/midai/ class=more-link>read more</a></div></article><article class=summary><h3><a href=/miwai/>miwai</a></h3><div class=meta><time>Friday 17 Jun 2022</time></div><div class=content>from practice to theory<a href=/miwai/ class=more-link>read more</a></div></article><div class=small><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://thisismitime.com/>this is mitime</a></p></div></div></footer></body></html>
