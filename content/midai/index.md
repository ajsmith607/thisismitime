The uniform subdivisions of mitime lend themselves to structured planning tools, such as this simple Standard Mitime midaily planner (which can obviously be easily adjusted for different mitimezones): 

{{< miplanner >}}

This clearly shows how the day can be organized according to goals and priorities, with the mi representing larger scoped areas, such as a project, a complex task, or an area of your life, while the mihours represent smaller milestones, subtasks, etc. Because all units are equal, they are easily interchangeable and can be rearranged as needed, with minimal overall disruption.

Immediate implications are that knowing the mitime doesn't tell you the time of day so much as it tells you where you are in your day, how well you are progressing against your goals, and how much time remains. 

While this is useful for task planning, it perhaps excels even more at planning the structure of your day. Mitime's emphasis on available time encourages you to think about whether you are spending that finite and precious resource on the things you value most. Mitime encourages you to focus and prioritize effort to further your life mission, to achieve goals, to adopt new habits, or to break bad ones.
